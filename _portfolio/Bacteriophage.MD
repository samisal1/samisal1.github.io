There are approximately 10^31 bacteriophages in the world, but fewer than three thousand have been characterized. More progress can be made in phage therapy, the therapeutic use of phages, if we have more information. The goal of this study was to expand our knowledge of the phage population. In this study, a novel bacteriophage, PetiteSangsue, was characterized. PetiteSangsue was isolated from a soil sample using Mycobacterium smegmatis as the host. To ensure a pure and homogeneous phage population, four rounds of plaque purification were performed. PetiteSangsue forms turbid plaques, suggesting it is a temperate bacteriophage. Large numbers of the purified phage were grown to facilitate the isolation of the phage genome. The genomic DNA was digested with restriction enzymes, and the products were analyzed using gel electrophoresis. The entire genome of PetiteSangsue was sequenced using the Illumina Sequencing platform. By comparing the sequence of PetiteSangsue to DNA sequence databases, I concluded it belongs to the A4 subcluster of mycobacteriophages, which consists of 125 phages. Based on Electron Microscope analysis, I concluded that PetiteSangsue is a siphoviridae bacteriophage with icosahedral, sticky heads, and non-contractile tails.
